This is a locking script for i3lock-color, that monitors xscreensaver's blanking status.

When your screensaver activates, it will take a picture of your desktop, blur it,
and change the color overlay (currently set to match Bergren theme colors).

Once the screensaver is woken, it will display the lock screen.

It is intended to be ran at the start of your session.

Install mx-lock.sh to /usr/local/bin/
Install lock.png to /usr/local/share/mx-lock/

Don't forget to chmod +x mx-lock.sh
