This is my current lemonbar script. It (in it's current configuration) requires
the https://github.com/krypt-n/bar fork of lemonbar, along with conky.

The script is very flexibl and even monitors xrandr, dynamically adjusting itself
to the addition, removal, or modification of screens and screensize.

It is also designed to be used with herbstluft, however this could probably
easily be modified to be compatible with i3 or other windows managers. The
modifications you would need to make would be in lemonbar-launch,
specifically regarding the padding routine, and also the way it queries the
current workspace names.

In addition, I also modified the apt-notifier program included with my MX-16
(Debian) distro, so that it could be used to pipe the number of package updates
that are currently available for upgrade. I have included the modified apt-notifier.py
file, which you can use if you choose to. If not, then remove the related routines
from both lemonbar-launch and lemonbar_parser.sh.

The config and conky files will be created the first time you run the
scripts, in ~/.config/lemonbar

The script initially assumes you placed the lemonbar_parser.sh file in the dir:
    /usr/local/share/lemonbar/
    
-- HOWEVER, if you wish the place it elsewhere in the long run, you can alter the
parser="" line in the created ~/.config/lemonbar/lemonbar.conf file, to point to
whatever alternate location you wish to place the parser script.

Don't forget to chmod +x lemonbar-launch
    chmod +x lemonbar_parser.sh
    chmod +x apt-notifier.py
